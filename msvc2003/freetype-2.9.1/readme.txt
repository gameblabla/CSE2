This is a static build of Freetype 2.9.1, built with MSVC2003.

Despite the lack of a compatible .sln file, it can be build by running
'make visualc' in the root of the Freetype source directory while in a
Visual Studio 2003 Command Prompt, using a MinGW Make utility
(e.g. C:/msys64/mingw32/bin/make.exe).
